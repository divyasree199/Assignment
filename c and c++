C and C++ are both programming languages, and while they share similarities, they also have key differences. Here are some of the main distinctions between C and C++:

1.Paradigm:

C: Procedural programming language.
C++: Multi-paradigm language supporting procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming.

2.Object-Oriented Programming:

C: Does not support object-oriented programming (OOP) features.
C++: Supports OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

3.Classes and Objects:

C: Lacks the concept of classes and objects.
C++: Introduces classes and objects as fundamental building blocks.

4.Function Overloading:

C: Does not support function overloading.
C++: Supports function overloading, allowing multiple functions with the same name but different parameters.

5.Operator Overloading:

C: Does not support operator overloading.
C++: Allows overloading of operators for user-defined types.

6.Memory Management:

C: Primarily relies on functions like malloc() and free() for dynamic memory management.
C++: Introduces new and delete operators for dynamic memory management, and also supports the concept of constructors and destructors for automatic memory management using objects.

7.Standard Template Library (STL):

C: Lacks a standard template library.
C++: Includes the STL, which provides generic classes and functions with templates, algorithms, and containers.

8.Namespace:

C: Does not support namespaces.
C++: Introduces namespaces to avoid naming conflicts.

9.Header Files:

C: Uses header files like .h for function prototypes and declarations.
C++: Continues to use header files but often omits the .h extension, and introduces iostream for input/output operations.

10.Compatibility:

C: Code written in C is often compatible with C++.
C++: While C code is generally compatible, some C++ features may not be understood by a C compiler.
