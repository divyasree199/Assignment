Arduino libraries are pre-written sets of code or functions that simplify the process of programming an Arduino board. These libraries provide ready-to-use functionalities for various tasks, allowing developers to focus on their specific projects without having to write complex code from scratch. Here are some commonly used Arduino libraries:

1.Wire (I2C):

Library for I2C communication, enabling communication with I2C devices like sensors and displays.

2.SPI:

Library for Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) communication, used for communication with devices like SD cards and certain sensors.

3.Servo:

Allows control of servo motors, commonly used in robotics and other projects requiring precise motor control.

4.Stepper:

For controlling stepper motors, which are commonly used in applications like CNC machines and 3D printers.

5.SD:

Enables reading and writing data to SD cards, useful for data logging and storing large amounts of information.

6.Ethernet:

Facilitates Ethernet communication, allowing Arduino boards to connect to a local network or the internet.

7.WiFi:

Provides functionality for connecting Arduino boards to Wi-Fi networks, enabling IoT (Internet of Things) applications.

8.LiquidCrystal:

Simplifies the control of character LCD displays, commonly used in various projects for visual feedback.

9.Adafruit NeoPixel:

Facilitates control of addressable RGB LEDs (NeoPixels), allowing for colorful lighting effects.

10.DHT:

Library for DHT series sensors, commonly used for measuring temperature and humidity.

11.IRremote:

Allows Arduino to receive and send infrared signals, useful for remote control applications.
